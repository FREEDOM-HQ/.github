Welcome to the FREEDOM headquarters operating on the planet Kepler-186F!

We're a development group focusing on Linux, Android, and the DSiPaint archival process. We have done quite a bit of things over the years. So sit back, and relax. We're a chill community.

We also hope you can all stick around for the exciting future of the inclusive FREEDOM-HQ scene.
